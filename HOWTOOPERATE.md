- Execute the main program file (`FortniteHax.exe` or equivalent).

### Step 2: Load the AI Model

- Place your pre-trained YOLOv8 model file in this directory.
- Use the programâ€™s interface to load the model into memory before starting.

### Step 3: Configure Mouse Inputs
- Open the settings menu and select your preferred mouse input method:
  - **SendInput**: Standard mouse input.
  - **SendInput Stealth**: Optimized for stealth operation.

### Step 4: Select Execution Type
FortniteHax supports multiple execution backends. Choose one based on your hardware capabilities:
- **CUDA**: Best performance for systems with NVIDIA GPUs.
- **TensorRT**: High-performance inference for supported GPUs.
- **CPU**: Last-resort option for systems without GPU support (slower performance).

### Step 5: Configure Screen Capture
- FortniteHax supports two screen capture methods:
  - **DirectX**: Recommended for best compatibility and performance.
  - **GDI**: Backup method for systems that do not support DirectX.
- Select your preferred method in the settings menu.
